It is completely fine to use Anki alongside Slangbrain.
Anki also comes with some features, such as audio reading, which Slangbrain doesn't have.
But if you have a deck full of vocabulary in Anki which you would rather study in Slangbrain, that is really simple to achieve.

**Let's see how this works in three simple steps:**
<br>
*(You should do this on your computer, not your phone)*

## 1. Select Export

Open Anki, click the settings wheel on the right side of a deck and select *Export*.

## 2. Export as Notes

Now you need to select *Notes in Plain Text* as *Export format*, then click *Exportâ€¦* and save the file to a location where you can find it.

## 3. Drag Into Messenger

Lastly you open [Slangbrain in Messenger](https://www.messenger.com/t/slangbrain), drag&drop the *.txt* file you exported from Anki right into Messenger, and simply confirm the import with the *yes* button.


That's all.

Don't worry about accidentally importing the same word twice, Slangbrain will catch that for you.
And if you ever import something wrong, you can always *manage your phrase* in the *help* menu.
