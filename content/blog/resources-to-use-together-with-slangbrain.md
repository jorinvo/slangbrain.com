[As mentioned before]({{% ref "blog/why-i-created-slangbrain.md" %}}),
you will always benefit from adding more variation to your language studies:

To learn a language we need to memorize things.
Memorization is done through repetition.
To make words stuck in your memory you need to build connections where it can be get stuck at.
By using multiple methods of studies you give your brain a change to recognize words you saw before in a different context.
Encountering the same words in different scenarios will help you to remember them with less effort.

We encourage you to have a look at other resources for studying and we like to share some of our favorites with you:

## 1. Anki

[![Anki](/images/blog/anki.png)](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)

[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) has been [mentioned before]({{% ref "blog/why-i-created-slangbrain.md" %}}), but is worth it to talk about again here.
It has a use case similar to Slangbrain, but it offers more customization.
Some users have put a lot of work into creating great collections of vocabulary which can be found [here](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/).
If you find any interesting Anki decks, but would like to study in Slangbrain, check out your article on [how to import Anki decks into Slakngbrain]({{% ref "blog/how-to-import-phrases-from-anki.md" %}}).
In some cases we would recommend you using Anki though, because certain Decks come with audio readings of the vocabulary.


## 2. Duolingo

[![Duolingo](/images/blog/duolingo.png)](https://www.duolingo.com/)

[Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) is a well-made application that offers free language course, which guide you through the basics of a variety of language in a playful way.
If you just started learning a new language, we highly recommend you to have a look if Duolingo offers any courses for the language.
They put a lot of effort into gathering useful vocabulary in fun courses. Using their app sometimes feels like playing a game, and it's all free as long as you are fine with an advertisement popping up once in a while.


## 3. Memrise

[![Memrise](/images/blog/memrise.png)](https://www.memrise.com/home/)

[Memrise](https://www.memrise.com/home/) feels in many ways similar to Duolingo.
They also offer free courses for many languages and we recommend you giving it a try.
It is also not wrong to take courses on Memrise and Duolingo in parallel. They both have their unique, playful feel to them
and more repetition helps you memorizing faster.


## 4. Resources specific to your language

All three previous mentioned applications are, same as Slangbrain, not limited to any specific language
and you can learn a lot from them, especially when you are at the beginning of learning a new language.

However as your knowledge advances the things you learn and encounter will be more detailed and nuanced.
At some point you are best of looking for new resources of content which is specific to your language and all its quirks.

There are great applications other there focusing on specific languages and should probably also consider
buying a dictionary to lookup small details between words and grammar rules that not even a native speaker can explain you.
When looking for a dictionary, it might also be a good idea to buy a single-language dictionary to get even more accurate knowledge.


## 5. Emerge in the language

At some point you will not profit that much anymore from studying with material specifically intended for language students,
but you should instead find real things in that interest you.
You can watch movies, read books and online articles and, most important of all, talk to people.
But to get the most out of it, you should still lookup things you don't know, keep notes and memorize the things.
Even as you reach the point of language studying, that you can use it in the real world, you should keep on learning.
A tool like [Slangbrain](/) can help you to simplify that challenge.
