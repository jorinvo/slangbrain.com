It has never been easier to learn a new language than it is today.
In the past, the only way to study a language was to attend a language course in person.
Now we have many possibilities to learn on our own, find our way and stay motivated while doing so.

There are many great applications and other resources out there to get started with studying a language.
Why create another one?

Nothing is wrong with existing resources and
I strongly encourage anyone trying to learn a new language to try out many different ways of studying.
Slangbrain does not attempt to replace any existing application.
Instead, it is an attempt to fulfill a specific need which is not covered by existing resources to the extend I wish for.

Most existing resources provide you with a course of studies, they teach you specific vocabulary, grammar and exercises.
There is nothing wrong with that and you definitely need these when learning a new language.
However, after you reached a certain level of fluency, you try to explore new material on your own or even move to a foreign country,
and you will pick up new words, and phrases people use to express themselves in your everyday life.

To get to the next level of fluency, you need to memorize, what you pickup.
In the beginning you might carry around a little notebook, writing down sentences you would like to remember.
But then you need to find a good way to memorize these words later on.

_**Wouldn't it be useful to not carry a notebook to write down words, but instead save them directly in your phone,
and your phone would automatically help you to remember these words?**_

Making this become possible is the goal of Slangbrain.

**Slangbrain** is about making the *slang* you pick up in your everyday life become part of your *brain*.


Of course, Slangbrain is not the first attempt to tackle this problem.
One alternative to Slangbrain I highly encourage you to have a look at is [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/),
which is a great and flexible application to study your own vocabulary.
I even suggest you to use both, Anki and Slangbrain, at the same time - each for the parts of your studies you feel most comfortable with.
[Combining different ways of learning]({{% ref "blog/resources-to-use-together-with-slangbrain.md" %}}) can help you improve the efficiency of your studies.

Anki comes with many settings for optimizing your study experience and people found many [creative ways](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/) to use it.
You should make use of them. Maybe you even see a good way to [combine it with Slangbrain]({{% ref "blog/how-to-import-phrases-from-anki.md" %}}).

The focus of Slangbrain is on simplicity.
The friction of taking out your phone, adding a new phrase and studying phrases should be as low as possible.
You don't have to worry about any setup, you don't even have to register or download any app.

Open [Facebook Messenger](https://m.me/slangbrain) and start using Slangbrain.
