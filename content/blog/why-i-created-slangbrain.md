It has never been easier to learn a new language.
While in the past the only way to study a language was to attend a language course in person,
we have many possibilities now to learn on our own, find our way and stay motivated while doing so.

There are many great applications and other resources out there to get started studying a language.
Why create another one?

Nothing is wrong with existing resources and
I strongly encourage anyone trying to learn a new language to try out many different ways of studying.
Slangbrain does not attempt to replace any existing application.
Instead, it is an attempt to fulfill a specific need which is not covered by existing resources to the extend I wish for.

Most existing resources provide you with a course of studies, they teach you specific vocabulary, grammar and exercises.
There is nothing wrong with that and you definitely need these when learning a new language.
However, after you reached a certain level of fluency, try to explore new material on your own or even moved to a foreign country,
you will start to pick up new words, and specific phrases people use to express themselves.

To get to the next level of fluency, you need to pick up this knowledge.
In the beginning you might carry around a little notebook, writing down sentences you would like to remember.
But then you need to find a good way to memorize these words later on.

_**Wouldn't it be useful to not carry a notebook to write down words, but instead save them directly in your phone,
and your phone would automatically help you memorize these words?**_

Making this become possible is the main goal of Slangbrain.

**Slangbrain** is about making the *slang* you pick up in your everyday life become part of your *brain*.


Of course, Slangbrain is not the first attempt to solve this problem.
I highly encourage you to have a look at [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/),
which is a great and flexible application to study your own vocabulary.
I even suggest you to use both applications, each for the parts of your studies where you feel most comfortable.
[Combining different ways of learning]({{% ref "blog/resources-to-use-together-with-slangbrain.md" %}}) can help you improve the efficiency of your studies.

Anki comes with many settings for fine-tuning your study experience and people found many [creative ways](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/) to use it.
You should make use of them. Maybe you even see a good way to [combine it with Slangbrain]({{% ref "blog/how-to-import-phrases-from-anki.md" %}}).

The focus of Slangbrain is on simplicity.
The friction to taking out your phone, adding a new phrase and studying phrase should be as low as possible.
You don't have to worry about any setup, you don't even have to register or download any app.
