In Slanbgrain words can be exported an imported simply as files.
We refer to those files as *collections*.

Collections are saved in a *.csv* file.
*CSV* stands for *comma separated values*.
You can think about a collection as a spreadsheet like in Excel, Google Docs or OpenOffice.
And you can use exactly these programs to edit them.

A collection is simply a table with two columns,
the first one contains the phrases in the foreign language
and the second one has the explanations in your mother tongue.

Now that we established the basics, we will see how you can use collections to share your phrases with friends,
how you use existing collections and how you can create new collections for you and others.


## 1. Share your phrases with others

All you have to do share your phrases is to go to the *help menu* in Slanbgrain and click the  button *export phrases*.

The file you get is a collection of your phrases which you can do with whatever you like.
You can send this file to a friend right away and your friend can simple drag it into Slanbgrain.
You can also upload the file to [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/), [WeTransfer](https://wetransfer.com/), [Cloudup](https://cloudup.com/)
or any other place where you get a public URL that you can share with people.
You can simply send such a link in a message to Slanbgrain, it will detect the file and import the phrases for you.


## 2. Import a list of phrases someone shared with you

If someone shares a collection of phrases with you or you find an interesting collection online, you can import them into Slanbgrain easily.

You can have a look at the starter collections on the Homepage:

**[Collections to get started](/#collections)**

Then you open [Slangbrain in Messenger](https://www.messenger.com/t/slangbrain) and drag&drop the *.csv* file right into Messenger.

Now you simply confirm the import with the *yes* button.


## 3. Create a new collection

You can create your own collection and share it with others.
To do so you simply need to create a file in the before mentioned format.

Let's see how you can do so using [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/),
but you can do the same also using Excel, OpenOffice or any other spreadsheet tool.

Go ahead and create a new spreadsheet. Then you give it a name, and fill in the first two columns with phrases
and their explanations respectively.
Here is an example document with some simple Japanese words:

{{% figure alt="Collection in Google Spreadsheet" src="/images/blog/spreadsheet.png" %}}

Once you finished creating the collection, you can go to the menu and download it as *.csv* file.
Now you have a collection that you can share with others and import into Slangbrain as mentioned above.
