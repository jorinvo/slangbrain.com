In Slangbrain words can be exported and imported simply as files.
We refer to those files as *collections*.

Collections are saved in a *.csv* file.
*CSV* stands for *comma separated values*.
You can think about a collection as a spreadsheet like in Excel, Google Docs or OpenOffice.
And you can use exactly these programs to edit collections.

A collection is a table with two columns,
the first one contains the phrases in the foreign language
and the second one explanations in your mother tongue.

Now that we established the basics, we will see how you can use collections to share your phrases with friends,
how to import collections and how to create new collections for you and others.


## 1. Share your phrases with others

All you have to do to share your phrases is to go to the *help menu* in Slangbrain and click the  button *export phrases*.

The file you get is a collection of your phrases.
You can send this file to a friend right away and your friend can simple drag it into Slangbrain.
You can also upload the file to [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/), [WeTransfer](https://wetransfer.com/), [Cloudup](https://cloudup.com/)
or any other place where you get a public link that you can share with people.
If you have a link to a collection you can send it as a message to Slangbrain, it will detect the file and import the phrases for you.


## 2. Import a list of phrases someone shared with you

If someone shares a collection of phrases with you or you find an interesting collection online, you can import it into Slangbrain easily.

To try it out, you can pick one of the starter collections here:

**[Collections to get started](/#collections)**

Then you open [Slangbrain in Messenger](https://www.messenger.com/t/slangbrain) and drag the *.csv* file right into Messenger.

Now confirm the import with the *yes* button.


## 3. Create a new collection

You can create a new collection and share it with others.
To do so you need to create a file in the before mentioned format.

Let's see how you can do so using [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/),
but you can do the same also using Excel, OpenOffice or any other spreadsheet tool.

Go ahead and create a new spreadsheet.
Then give it a name, and fill in the first two columns with phrases and their explanations respectively.
An spreadsheet with some easy Japanese words would look like this:

{{% figure alt="Collection in Google Spreadsheet" src="/images/blog/spreadsheet.png" %}}

Once you finished creating the collection, you can go to the menu and download it as *.csv* file.
Now you have a collection that you can share with others and import into Slangbrain as mentioned above.
