Many of us not only learn one, but multiple languages at the same time.
Even after many years of studying you will always pick up something new once in a while.
So although you might only actively study one language at the moment, you might still learn new things in another language at the same time.

If this is the case for you and you tried using Slangbrain for multiple of your languages, you might have had difficulties to guess which language to answer in while studying.

But there is a solution to this:


{{% figure alt="same word in multiple languages" src="/images/blog/polyglot.png" %}}

If you need to differentiate multiple languages, simply prefix the explanation of each phrase with a little emoji flag.


I hope this was helpful. If you have any question or feedback, let us know on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/slangbrain/).
