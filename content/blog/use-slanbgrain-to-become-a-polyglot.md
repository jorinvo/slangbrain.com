There are many of us that not only learn one, but multiple languages at the same time.
Even after many years of studying, as long as a language is not your mother tongue, you will always pick up something new once in a while.
So even if you actively study only one language at the moment, you might still learn new things in another language at the same time.

If this is the case for you and you tried using Slanbgrain for multiple of your languages, you might have had troubles to know which language to translate to while studying.

But there is a simple solution to this:


{{% figure alt="same word in multiple languages" src="/images/blog/polyglot.png" %}}

If you need to differentiate multiple language just prefix the explanation of each phrase with a little emoji flag.


I hope this was helpful. If you have any questions or feedback, let us know on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/slangbrain/).
