Bullets:
- Slangbrain doesn't tell you what to study, you save whatever is interesting to you, and Slangbrain makes sure you won't ever forget it.
- Learn any phrase, in any language. Remember things the way you actually use them instead of learning single words.
- No need to register or download yet another app, just chat with Slangbrain right in Messenger.
- Slangbrain is not yet another language course, use it together with other apps.
- Slangbrain sends you a message when it's time to review your vocabulary.
- Not another bot that lets you guess words. Use simple buttons as controls.
- And it's all free to use.
